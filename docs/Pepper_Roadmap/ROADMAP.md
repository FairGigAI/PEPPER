# P.E.P.P.E.R. Project Roadmap

## 🎯 Project Overview
P.E.P.P.E.R. (Programmable Execution & Processing for Project Engineering & Robotics) is an autonomous SaaS development system that transforms ideas into production-ready MVPs. It operates as a distributed team of specialized AI agents, each working in isolated environments while coordinating through a central orchestrator.

## 📋 Current Status (March 2025)

### Core System
- ✅ Project setup and structure
- ✅ Core system architecture
- ✅ Agent framework
- ✅ Configuration system
- ✅ Logging system
- ✅ Task routing system
- ✅ Monitoring system
- ✅ Daily summary reporting

### Individual Agents (Basic Implementation)
- FrontendAgent
  - React component generation
  - TypeScript support
  - CSS styling
- BackendAgent
- QAAgent
- ProjectManagerAgent
- DocumentationAgent
- ClientIntakeAgent
- AIArchitectAgent
- InfraAgent
- SecurityAgent
- SlackBotAgent

### Infrastructure
- Docker setup in progress
- GitHub integration started
- CI/CD pipeline in setup
- Monitoring system partially implemented

## 🚨 Critical Issues
1. **Scope Drift**
   - No central coordination system
   - Agents working independently
   - Unclear project boundaries

2. **Timeline**
   - Phase 1 (Core) incomplete
   - Integration work delayed
   - No clear milestone tracking

3. **Functionality**
   - No fully working components
   - Missing critical integrations
   - Incomplete agent implementations

4. **Project Structure**
   - Inconsistent file organization
   - Redundant documentation
   - Missing key components

## 🎯 Success Criteria
- Accept prompt or whitepaper and generate full task map
- Assign and complete agent tasks with >90% accuracy
- Fully commit work to GitHub and notify via Slack
- MVP build complete with no more than 10% manual intervention
- Slack standups + documentation generated automatically
- At least one real project rebuilt autonomously

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
| KPI                          | Target                       |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| MVP turnaround time         | < 48 hours                   |
| Task success rate           | ≥ 90%                        |
| Retry recovery rate         | ≥ 80% for transient errors   |
| Manual intervention rate    | ≤ 10% per project            |
| GitHub/Slack integration    | 100% automated               |
| Documentation coverage      | ≥ 85% of agent tasks         |
