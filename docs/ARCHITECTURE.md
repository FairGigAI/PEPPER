# P.E.P.P.E.R. (Programmable Execution & Processing for Project Engineering & Robotics)

## Project Overview
P.E.P.P.E.R. is an autonomous SaaS development system that transforms ideas into production-ready MVPs. It operates as a distributed team of specialized AI agents, each working in isolated environments while coordinating through a central orchestrator.

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Components

#### Orchestrator
- Central coordination system
- Task distribution and dependency management
- Human checkpoint coordination
- Agent communication hub
- Project state management

#### Agent Environment
Each agent operates in an isolated environment:
- Individual Cursor/VSCode instances
- Containerized execution
- Project-specific context
- Zero-trust security model

#### Client Interface
- Web dashboard for project management
- Slack integration for notifications
- API access for enterprise clients
- Documentation portal

### 2. Agent Types

#### Primary Agents
- ProjectManagerAgent: Project planning and coordination
- FrontendAgent: UI/UX development
- BackendAgent: API and service development
- QAAgent: Testing and validation
- DocumentationAgent: Documentation and wikis

#### Support Agents
- ClientIntakeAgent: Requirements gathering
- AIArchitectAgent: System architecture
- InfraAgent: Infrastructure management
- SecurityAgent: Security auditing
- SlackBotAgent: Communication

### 3. System Flow

1. **Project Initiation**
   - Client submits idea/MVP goal
   - ClientIntakeAgent gathers requirements
   - AIArchitectAgent designs architecture
   - ProjectManagerAgent creates roadmap

2. **Development Cycle**
   - Agents work in isolated environments
   - Orchestrator manages task flow
   - Regular checkpoints for human review
   - Automated testing and validation

3. **Deployment**
   - Infrastructure setup
   - Security validation
   - Production deployment
   - Monitoring setup

### 4. Technical Requirements

#### Performance
- Task completion < 30 seconds
- MVP build time < 48 hours
- Support for 100+ concurrent tasks

#### Security
- Zero-trust architecture
- Isolated agent environments
- Secure credential management
- GitHub token scoping

#### Integration
- GitHub: Version control and CI/CD
- Slack: Communication and alerts
- ChromaDB: Task memory
- Docker: Containerization
- PostgreSQL: Project data

### 5. Development Guidelines

#### Agent Development
1. Inherit from BaseAgent
2. Implement isolated environment
3. Add security measures
4. Include logging and monitoring

#### Project Management
1. Define clear interfaces
2. Document dependencies
3. Implement retry logic
4. Add checkpoint support

#### Client Interaction
1. Design intuitive dashboard
2. Implement approval flows
3. Add progress tracking
4. Include documentation
