# 📄 P.E.P.P.E.R. Project Definition & Planning

## 🚀 Mission Statement

Build a modular, autonomous AI-powered development team (P.E.P.P.E.R.) capable of delivering full SaaS MVPs from idea to deployment with minimal human intervention, integrating GitHub, Slack, and custom agent logic to simulate and outperform traditional software teams.

---

## ✅ Success Criteria

- Accept prompt or whitepaper and generate full task map
- Assign and complete agent tasks with >90% accuracy
- Fully commit work to GitHub and notify via Slack
- MVP build complete with no more than 10% manual intervention
- Slack standups + documentation generated automatically
- At least one real project (e.g., 8thDegree) rebuilt autonomously

## 🧱 Feature Prioritization

### 🟢 Must-Have
- Orchestrator + PM Agent routing tasks
- Frontend, Backend, and QA agents working in isolation
- Benchmark project breakdown and rebuild
- Docker container per agent
- Slack alerts + GitHub commits

### 🟡 Nice-to-Have
- Client dashboard (Streamlit or Next.js)
- DocumentationAgent with SOP/Markdown output
- ClientIntakeAgent to parse whitepapers
- Agent overlay (Cursor-style UI)
- ChromaDB integration for long-term memory

### 🔴 Out-of-Scope (for MVP)
- Drag-and-drop frontend builder
- Real-time natural language dev assistant
- Human hiring or decision logic
- Agent cross-talk outside orchestrator law

---

## ⚙️ Technical Requirements

### ⚡ Performance
- Each task should run in < 30s
- Agents handle up to 100 queued tasks
- Project builds must compile and run locally

### 🔐 Security
- Zero-trust between agents
- Orchestrator enforces hierarchy and stop-work
- GitHub tokens project-scoped only
- Slack webhooks secured via env vars

### 🔗 Integration
| System     | Purpose                     |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| GitHub     | Commits, branches, PRs      |
| Slack      | Daily standups, alerts      |
| Docker     | Agent runtime isolation     |
| PostgreSQL | Config, task queue, metrics |
| ChromaDB   | Vector memory + context     |
