# PEPPER Architecture

## System Overview

PEPPER is built on a multi-agent architecture where each agent is responsible for specific aspects of project management and execution.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent System
- Each agent runs in an isolated Docker container
- Agents communicate through a secure message bus
- Agents have specific roles and responsibilities

### 2. Integration Layer
- GitHub integration for repository management
- Slack integration for team communication
- API endpoints for external access

### 3. Core Services
- Task management system
- Resource allocation
- Monitoring and logging
- Security and authentication

## Security Architecture

1. **Container Isolation**
   - Each agent runs in its own container
   - Limited system access through seccomp profiles
   - Network isolation between containers

2. **Authentication**
   - API key-based authentication
   - OAuth for GitHub and Slack
   - Role-based access control

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypted communication
   - Secure credential storage
   - Regular security audits

## Monitoring and Logging

1. **System Monitoring**
   - Container health checks
   - Resource usage tracking
   - Performance metrics

2. **Logging**
   - Structured logging format
   - Log aggregation
   - Error tracking

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Organization**
   - Follow the established directory structure
   - Keep components modular and testable
   - Document all public interfaces

2. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Integration tests for agent interactions
   - End-to-end tests for critical paths

3. **Deployment**
   - Use Docker for containerization
   - Follow CI/CD best practices
   - Maintain deployment documentation
