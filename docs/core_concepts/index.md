# Core Concepts

Welcome to the core concepts documentation for PEPPER. This section provides detailed information about the fundamental components and systems that make up PEPPER.

## Overview

PEPPER is built on several key concepts that work together to provide an efficient and intelligent project management system:

1. **Agents**: Autonomous components that handle specific tasks
2. **Tasks**: Structured units of work that can be assigned to agents
3. **Feedback System**: Mechanism for continuous improvement
4. **Orchestration**: System for coordinating agents and tasks

## Components

### [Agents](agents.md)

Agents are the core components of PEPPER that handle specific project management tasks. Each agent is specialized in a particular domain and can work autonomously or in collaboration with other agents.

Key features:
- Autonomous operation
- Specialized capabilities
- Inter-agent communication
- Performance tracking

### [Task Management](tasks.md)

The task management system in PEPPER provides a structured approach to handling project tasks. It includes features for task creation, assignment, tracking, and completion.

Key features:
- Task creation and assignment
- Dependency management
- Progress tracking
- Resource allocation

### [Feedback System](feedback_system.md)

PEPPER's feedback system enables continuous improvement through systematic collection, analysis, and application of feedback from various sources.

Key features:
- Feedback collection
- Performance analysis
- Metric tracking
- Improvement application

### [Orchestration](orchestration.md)

The orchestration system manages the coordination and execution of tasks across multiple agents, ensuring efficient resource utilization and optimal task completion.

Key features:
- Task distribution
- Resource management
- Workflow control
- System monitoring

## Getting Started

To get started with PEPPER, we recommend:

1. Understanding the [Agents](agents.md) system
2. Learning about [Task Management](tasks.md)
3. Exploring the [Feedback System](feedback_system.md)
4. Understanding [Orchestration](orchestration.md)

## Best Practices

When working with PEPPER, consider these best practices:

1. **Agent Usage**
   - Match tasks to agent capabilities
   - Monitor agent performance
   - Maintain agent health
   - Regular agent updates

2. **Task Management**
   - Clear task descriptions
   - Proper dependency setup
   - Regular progress updates
   - Resource optimization

3. **Feedback Collection**
   - Regular feedback gathering
   - Performance monitoring
   - Quality metrics
   - Improvement tracking

4. **System Orchestration**
   - Efficient resource allocation
   - Workflow optimization
   - Error handling
   - System monitoring

## Next Steps

After understanding the core concepts, you can:

1. Set up your PEPPER environment
2. Configure your agents
3. Create your first tasks
4. Monitor system performance
