## Project Overview
P.E.P.P.E.R. (Programmable Execution & Processing for Project Engineering & Robotics) is an autonomous SaaS development system that transforms ideas into production-ready MVPs. It operates as a distributed team of specialized AI agents, each working in isolated environments while coordinating through a central orchestrator.

## Building an AI Infrastructure to Keep AI Agents Efficient and on Track

The challenge is orchestrating multiple AI agents to ensure they work together without drifting from the overall vision. The key is to implement an AI Coordination System that continuously checks progress against client project scope and goals.

## Step 1: Introduce a ‚ÄúProject Orchestrator‚Äù AI Agent
Right now, each AI agent works independently without a unifying checkpoint system.

Solution: Build a central ‚ÄúProject Orchestrator AI‚Äù (POA)
This agent will:
- Track all active agents and their assigned tasks.
- Continuously validate progress against the original 8thDegree roadmap.
- Detect scope drift or redundancies in real-time.
- Send corrective guidance to respective agent(s) before they drift too far.

How to Implement This?
- Use GitHub Projects & Issues as the single source of truth for the project roadmap.
- Hook Agent into a GitHub Wiki & Notion that serves as the master documentation.
- POA reads Agents commits & PRs to check if they align with the roadmap.
- POA continuously updates your GitHub Project Board with AI progress summaries.
- POA reviews PRs before merging, ensuring consistency.

Potential Tech Stack:
- FastAPI backend to manage agent coordination
- GPT API (Custom AI agent) for oversight
- GitHub Actions to check scope consistency
- Zapier or n8n to link Notion & GitHub

## Step 2: Implement ‚ÄúAgent Scopes‚Äù with Defined Responsibilities
Right now, Cursor lacks structured guidance for prioritization. You need a clear AI delegation system where each agent has a defined scope.

‚û° Solution: Break Down Agent Responsibilities
Instead of all agents operating blindly, define:
- Pepper  ‚Üí Strategic oversight & course correction
- Each Agent ‚Üí Strictly executes defined code updates (no decision-making).
- Project Orchestrator AI ‚Üí Validates progress, prevents scope drift.
- Each agent only works within its domain, but all updates sync through the Project Orchestrator AI (POA).

Potential ways how to Implement. **this needs imporvement**
- Set strict roles in Notion/GitHub for what Agents can and cannot do.
- POA reviews every request before execution.
- POA flags unfinished dependencies before each agent moves forward.

## Step 3: Implement Continuous AI Scope Validation
The biggest risk is scope drift‚Äîwhere agents start working on submodules that don‚Äôt align with the bigger goal.

‚û° Solution: Use a ‚ÄúScope Validator‚Äù AI Checkpoint
- Every time an agent executes a change, an AI scope validator runs pre-checks:
- Is this code change part of an approved feature set?
- Does this change affect the core roadmap negatively?
- Are there unfinished dependencies before moving forward?

If YES ‚Üí Agent proceeds.
If NO ‚Üí POA/PEPPER blocks the task and requests a course correction.

Potential Tech Stack options. **this needs updated and work**
- GitHub Actions for automated scope validation
- FastAPI AI Agent to read PRs & validate changes

## Step 4: Visual Oversight & Progress Dashboards 
Right now, a big struggle is keeping an overview of overall project progress.

‚û° Solution: A Unified Project Scope Dashboard
Instead of scrolling through Agents logs, create a real-time visual dashboard that shows:
- Which agents are active
- What tasks are being worked on
- Which areas need attention
- Overall progress against milestones

## Step 5: Implement AI-Generated ‚ÄúDaily Standup‚Äù Reports
I want to be managing a virtual AI team and treat it like a real dev team.

‚û° Solution: A Daily AI Standup Report
Every morning, you get an automated report that summarizes:
- What progress was made in the last 24 hours
- What blockers exist
- What‚Äôs pending approval (Human-in-the-loop checkpoints)
- What scope changes need review

How to Build This? **where are we with this**
AI scans GitHub commits and documentation
AI compiles key progress points.
AI sends a Slack/Email update summarizing everything.

## Step 6: Add Human Override Safeguards
AI can only do so much‚ÄîClient still needs to be in control.

‚û° Solution: Milestone Based Human Oversight Reviews
- Every milestone, you get a manual review prompt.
- Client approve or reject major shifts in direction.
- AI cannot merge certain major changes without manual sign-off.

## The Big Picture
This AI infrastructure (P.E.P.P.E.R.) turns any idea into a scalable MVP project, 
structured project‚Äîwhere every agent knows its role, and client never lose sight of the overall scope.

I/Clients will have: 
- Agents coding efficiently without scope drift.
- An AI orchestrator ensuring alignment.
- A real-time dashboard tracking everything.
- Daily standups keeping you updated.

üî• We're building the infrastructure that makes AI-powered development actually WORK.
